The objective of this program was to understand how to perform basic calculations, how to create "for" loops, and how to generate specific printed results from user input.
This was accomplished by utilizing a combination of "if" and "for" loops in conjunction with imput by the user in order to calculate a specific output of characters, which was then printed as a result.
Of particular note was the issue of the user entering two or more characters in regards to a single input.
While this presented no issue in regards to the code of Project 1 (due to its simplicity) or the code of Projects 4 and 5 (due to the input being exclusively integers), this did prevent the code of Project 2 from functioning properly, necessitating the adjustments that led to the creation of Project 3.
With that said, an issue I observed in the development of this program was encountered in Projects 4 and 5; specifically, I was unsure of how to make a printed result that could be considered geometrically perfect relative to their respective intended results.
In simpler terms, I was unable to make a perfectly spaced parabola and circle, although the code of each project should still create results that can be considered accurate enough to at least appear recognizable as parabolas and circles.
